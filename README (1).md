# Quiz Web Application

## Overview
My quiz web app is an interactive platform where users can test their knowledge by answering quiz questions. The app starts with a home page where users enter their name before selecting a difficulty level:Easy, Medium, or Hard. Each level presents a set of questions with multiple-choice answers. Users navigate through the quiz smoothly, and the app ensures an engaging experience with a visually appealing design. Future improvements could include scoring, timers, and progress tracking to enhance user engagement.

## Features

- **Level Selection Page**: Users choose between Easy, Medium, and Hard levels.
- **Quiz Pages**: Each level has its own set of questions with answer options.
- **Navigation**: JavaScript handles transitions between pages.

## Technologies Used
